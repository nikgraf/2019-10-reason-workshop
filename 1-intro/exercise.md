## Data Structures

Create a data-structure for a chess figure with the following attributes: color, position, kind

- The color can be either black / white
- The position has 2 dimensions on a typical chess board
- The kind describes the value of the figure (king, tower, pawn …)

Put your data-structures in action by storing 2 chess figures in a collection called figures:

- Figure 1: Black, King, on position A1
- Figure 2: White, Tower, on position C7

I recommend to use this playground for this example: https://sketch.sh/

**Hint**: You may use lists, arrays, tuples, variants for these tasks
**Hint**: The position can designed in various ways e.g. a tuple of int or Variants. Keep in mind a Variant has to start with an upper case non-digit character.
